It is built for blockchain smart contracts.

This is a language make for state channels.

It is deterministic, so that every node of the blockchain gets the same result.

Functions are tail call optimized.

Has 2 types of gas, one for space, and one for time.

Instead of using goto for recursion, it uses function calls.

[Example code is in this folder](/examples) , hashlock has lots of documentation.
